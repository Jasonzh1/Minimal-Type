# My Personal Project

## Project Description
My project will be a game with **typing** as the main mechanic. You will be able
to select from a range of difficulties to complete the game. You will also be able
to pickup various items. The way to fight will 
be through typing a specific text and reaching a specific Words-Per-Minute.
People trying to practice their typing skills may be interested in this game.
This project is of interest to me because I have a passion for typing and
keyboards.
