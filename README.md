# My Personal Project

## Task 2
My project will be a game with **typing** as the main mechanic. It 
will be an adventure style game where you can walk around and 
explore, as well as collect different items. There will be a 
story where you can fight different bosses. The way to fight will 
be through typing a specific text and reaching a specific Words-Per-Minute.
People trying to practice their typing skills may be interested in this game.
This project is of interest to me because I have a passion for typing and
keyboards.
